# New Hire Tasks

## 1. Feature Engineering

Engineer features / attributes for modelling and reporting purposes. The features should be representative of the relationships between users, devices, ips, cards and transactions.

## 2. Network Analysis

Create device, ip and card networks to identify users groups / clusters.

## 3. Anomaly Detection

Using the engineered features from 1. and the user networks from 2. create an anomaly detection system to identify abnormal customer behaviour.

## 4. Predictive Modelling

Using the engineered features from 1. and the user networks from 2. create a model to classify fraudulent users.
